This is an application on Vala. Simple getting some quotes from the web.

The simplest app. I'm just doing it for fun and practicing my vala knowledges.
If you have some suggestions - please feel free to inform me.

About a compilation process. You'll need this vala packages: --pkg gtk+-3.0 --pkg libsoup-2.4 --pkg json-glib-1.0
So you will need this dependencies. But as well don't forget to install "valac" first.

if all set up well - use "make" command to build the file.
